# Use the Python console in order to evaluate the value of each one of the following expressions. Before you start, make sure you create the following two sets:
# >>> a = 12
# >>> b = 24
# >>> c = 7
# The expressions you should check their values are:
# c < a < b
# a < b < c
# c < a < b

a = 12
b = 24
c = 7

print("c < a < b:", c < a < b)
print("a < b < c:", a < b < c)
print("c < a < b:", c < a < b)
