# Use the Python console in order to evaluate the value of each one of the following expressions.
# Before you start, make sure you create the following two sets:
#   a = {1,2,3}
#   b = {2,3,4}
# The expressions you should check their values are:
#   a | b
#   a & b
#   a ^ b

a = {1, 2, 3}
b = {2, 3, 4}

print(a | b)
print(a & b)
print(a ^ b)
