### Notes
* first parameter is `self` inside the `def` when function is in the class.
* `__init__` variables must to be dynamic
* class name `Person(Inherited)`
* `super()` - usage of the inherited class, example:

`super().__init__(var1, var2)`
  * the `super()` is imported to use because it's a must to split and
stay organised which is inherited or not.
